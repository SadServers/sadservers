The website is running on an Nginx server, and you decide to add Brotli compression to it. Brotli has became very popular these days because of its high compression ratio. It's a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling. For this purpose, you decided to compile the brotli modules yourself and add them to the Nginx server. The location of the Brotli source code is at /home/admin/ngx_brotli, and nginx source code, which is needed to compile the modules, is located at /home/admin/nginx-1.18.0. You've seen from the official ngx_brotli repository that first you need to compile the brotli dependencies and then configure and make modules for Nginx, once you've done that, you need to add the modules to the Nginx configuration. After installing the modules, you need to make sure the responses from the server are being served with compression. Create a port-forward to port 80 from the server and check the header Content-Encoding, responses must return br for Brotli compression. You could also use curl -H \"Accept-Encoding: br, gzip\" -I http://localhost to check the header. PD: something nice about Brotli is that it fails over to gzip if the client doesn't support Brotli, so curl -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" -I http://localhost should return gzip instead.",

You need to figure out what's wrong with the replica and fix it. Since you are using Docker Compose, you can check the status of the running containers using docker compose ps (docker ps will do the job too). you may also want to check the logs of the containers. This is the file structure for this project: md /home/admin \u251c\u2500\u2500 postgres \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 master \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 initdb.d \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 01-roles.sql | | | |\u2500\u2500 02-replication.sql \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 03-dataset.sql \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 postgres.conf \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 replica \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 postgres.conf \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md All definition for the containers are inside docker-compose.yml file. You can get up the environment by running docker compose up -d and set it down by running docker compose down. If you make any change to the docker-compose.yml file, you can restart the containers by running docker compose up -d --force-recreate.",
